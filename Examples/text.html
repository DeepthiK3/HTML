California's diverse geography ranges from the Sierra Nevada in the east to the Pacific Coast in the west, from the redwood–Douglas fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest point (Mount Whitney) and the lowest point (Death Valley) in the contiguous United States. Earthquakes are common because of the state's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt.[12] Drought has also become a notable feature.[13]

California has had an enormous influence on global popular culture due to being the birthplace of the film industry, the hippie counterculture, the Internet,[14] and the personal computer. The state's economy is centered on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific and technical business services; together comprising 58% of the state's economy.[15] Three of the world's largest 20 firms by revenue, Chevron, Apple, and McKesson, are headquartered in the state.[16] Although only 1.5% of the state's economy,[15] California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state.[17] If it were a country, California would be the 6th largest economy in the world[18] and the 35th most populous.
